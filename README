What is it?

   This is a full text fork of mod_status for only machine automatique parsing.

   This is Status Module.  They display lots of internal data about how Apache is
   performing and the state of all children processes.

How to use it ?

   Load "mod_status" module and activate the "ExtendedStatus"

   LoadModule status_module modules/mod_status.so
   ExtendedStatus On

   them load mod_status_text and to enable it, add the following lines into any config file:

   LoadModule status_text_module modules/mod_status_text.so
   <Location /server-status-text>
   SetHandler server-status-text
   </Location>

   You may want to protect this location by password or domain so no one
   else can look at it.  Then you can access the statistics with a URL like:

   http://your_server_name/server-status-text

   They returns full text server status
